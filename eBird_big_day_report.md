I am imagining an intro something along the lines of:

*You may have heard that the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science recently fielded a team in Peru with the goal of raising support for museum-based research and also breaking the world big day record (the record for the most bird species seen in a single day). They surpassed the prior big day record of 331 with an astounding 354 bird species! eBird was a key part of this effort. Read more below.*



From the outset, it was very important to us to document carefully our big day effort using eBird checklists with associated notes, photographs, audio recordings, and video. Most big days are operated on an honor system - there is no witness or judge - and this seems to work overall. We decided, however, that if we carefully documented as many species as possible along the big day route, even if it was in the days leading up to the big day (we would be too busy on the day itself to take photos, recordings, or video), it would serve to bolster our claim to any record. 

More important than documenting the big day, however, was documenting the poorly known avifauna of a very interesting corner of South America. We planned to do the big day in the mountains of Abra Patricia and the adjacent Mayo Valley, but these were some of the last major landscape features in northern South America to be explored by ornithologists and birders. The first exploration, primarily by collecting expeditions from the LSU Museum of Natural Science under the leadership of John O’Neill, occurred in the 1970s as a highway was built over the mountains around Abra Patricia. To this day, the area remains poorly known, as evidenced by the presence of species that still remain to be described and named. This lack of knowledge is particularly glaring given the high number of species and the complexity of bird distributions in the area. In eBird, for example, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/GuideMe?step=saveChoices&getLocations=ibas&parentState=PE-SAM&bMonth=01&bYear=1900&eMonth=12&eYear=2014&reportType=location&ibas=PE_24462&ibas=PE_14677&continue.x=55&continue.y=9&continue=Continue">735 bird species</a> are known from the two Important Bird Areas comprising Abra Patricia and the Mayo Valley. A major goal of our big day effort was to help fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of birds in the region, and to make that information publicly available. 

For planning our scouting efforts, we relied heavily on existing data in eBird, and we thank the eBird team and the many dedicated observers involved in making this resource available. Armed with prior reports, we arrived in the Mayo Valley on 3 October and set out to scout the area. We took careful notes on our effort and the bird species and numbers observed at each site, often using a voice recorder to rapidly record data for later transcription and submission to eBird. We also took photographs, videos, and audio recordings of as many species as possible. You can see a list of all of the scouting eBird checklists below, including embedded media. Our favorites include an <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20305822">hour spent with the spectacular hummingbirds</a> coming to the feeders at Waqanki Lodge. Also rewarding, but much less relaxing, was a hike up to <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20307854">the crest of a ridge</a> in a successful attempt to see Ash-throated Antwren, a species described by LSU researchers. A quick visit to <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20308157">some new feeders</a> with Rufous-breasted Wood-Quail visiting was worthwhile. We ended up spending more time than planned birding in <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20308584">some excellent roadside marshes</a> northwest of Rioja. We found productive <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20315248">night birding in fields</a> north of Calzada. After a week or so scouting in the Mayo Valley lowlands, we headed to the mountains around Abra Patricia, within the Alto Mayo Protected Forest. Our first taste of the mountain birds was during a <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20309865">check of the hummingbird feeders</a> at the owlet lodge at Abra Patricia, and that night we <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20309917">spent some time</a> with the Long-whiskered Owlet itself (this species was another LSU discovery). The <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20317596">road near Abra Patricia itself</a> was very birdy, but that paled in comparison to <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20321820">birding a mega-flock</a> in the subtropical elevations downslope. Despite the rain, we enjoyed <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20321867">spending some time</a> with foraging *Tangara* tanagers, and birding was quite good when the <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20323199">rain let up briefly at Alto Nieva</a>. Finally, we finished our scouting in the lower subtropics <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20322667">staking out Lanceolated Monklet and scanning from bridges</a>. As we had hoped, we found some range extensions and unusual or poorly known species: <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20308584">Least Bittern</a> in the marshes northwest of Rioja, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20307788">Zone-tailed Hawk</a>, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20299906">good numbers of migrant shorebirds in rice fields</a>, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20306123">Ocellated Crake</a> and <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20306150">Stygian Owl</a> (both staked out by fantastic local guide Carlos Altamirano), <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20300321">Rufous-headed Woodpecker</a>, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20323322">Crested/Southern Caracara</a>, and <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20295171">Gray Elaenia and Tropical Gnatcatcher</a>. We also were able to see a <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20305720">species of manakin</a> still in the process of being described by LSU researchers. 

After 11 days of scouting, we were finally ready to attempt the big day on 14 October. We would connect many of the areas mentioned above by starting in Pomacochas west of the mountains of Abra Patricia, crossing over the mountains, and then descending to the lowlands of the Mayo Valley near Moyobamba. The day would be too fast-paced for taking photos, recordings, or video, but we would take time to record at least partial lists for each site for uploading to eBird. Night birding was productive, with a few waterbirds at Pomacochas Lake followed by a good diversity of highland owls and nightjars near Abra Patricia. We did very well birding at dawn and in the early morning, mostly along the road past Abra Patricia. Things slowed down, however, as the clouds cleared and the heat became intense in the lower subtropics. We missed a lot of the species we had scouted here and at the white sand forest around Aguas Verdes. After noon, however, clouds rolled back in and bird activity increased again. Open habitats and rice country were loaded with birds, and we did well in these areas. We were behind schedule, however, when we entered the forest, first at Waqanki Lodge and then at Morro de Calzada. We scrambled to find a last few forest birds right at dusk, and then tallied our total. 335 species! We had beat the previous American Birding Association-recognized big day record of 331 (see a video recounting that big day <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUXAEwWw-LQ">here</a>)! After some night birds (and noticing some birds we had forgotten to mark off), we finished at 354 species, a new world big day record! 

The big day was an effort to raise support and funding for the ongoing discovery based research on tropical birds being conducted by the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science (LSUMNS). The LSUMNS has been running expeditions throughout the Neotropics since the 1960's and these have resulted in the discovery of 42 new bird species, provided the catalyst for the formation of several of the extensive national parks in Peru and elsewhere, and improved knowledge of the distributions, identification, ecology, and systematics of Neotropical birds. We are accepting donations through our <a href="http://lsubigday.org">website</a>, which will be used for research expeditions in the Neotropics by LSU graduate students and researchers. Our big day would not have been possible with the wonderful support we received from our sponsors in Peru and the United States. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to PromPeru, Conservation International - Peru, Cajamarca Travel, Fundo Alto Nieva, The Tabasco Corportation, Eagle Optics, US AID, SERNANP, and the Bosque de Protección Alto Mayo.
