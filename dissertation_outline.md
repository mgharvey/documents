Dissertation Outline
====================

**Dissertation goal:** Develop and evaluate new methods of obtaining phylogeographic datasets and apply them to comparative phylogeography of Amazonian birds.

### Comparing sequence capture and RAD-Seq for phylogeography

We have been exploring the use of both sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and RAD-Seq in phylogeography. We, perhaps uniquely, have datasets from the same samples for both types of markers. This project is an attempt to evaluate the relative utility of either method for examining phylogeography.

**Status:** Re-analyzing data (first submission rejected)

### *Xenops minutus* phylogeography using RAD-Seq

We were interested in generating a larger, range-wide RAD-Seq dataset from a single species. *Xenops minutus* is a species that has been under investigation in the Brumfield lab for years, displays deep and complex population structure, and has a large number of available samples. We recovered nearly 4,000 loci from 72 individuals from eight areas of endemism, and reconstructed the population history by investigating isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-barriers, population structure, admixture, population expansion, migration, and selection and also estimating a population phylogeny.

### Relationship between phylogeographic structure and higher-level speciation rate

A long-standing question I've hoped to address is to what degree phylogeographic structure is important in longer-term diversification. In$

**Status:** Analyzing data

### Comparative phylogeography of varz√©a and terra firme birds in Amazonia

Perhaps my biggest goal is to obtain a large comparative phylogeographic dataset for Amazonian birds and to use it to evaluate the ability of various factors to predict phylogeographic history.

**Status:** Extracting samples
