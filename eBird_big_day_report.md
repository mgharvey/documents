From the outset, it was very important to us to carefully document our big day effort using eBird checklists with associated notes, photographs, audio recordings, and video. Most big days are operated on an honor system - there is no witness or judge - and this seems to work overall. We decided, however, that if we carefully documented as many species as possible along the big day route, even if it was in the days leading up to the big day (we would be too busy on the day itself to take photos, recordings, or video), it would serve to bolster our claim to any record. 

More important than documenting the big day, however, was documenting the poorly known avifauna of a very interesting corner of South America. Abra Patricia and the Mayo Valley were some of the last major landscape features in northern South America to be explored by ornithologists and birders. The first exploration, primarily by expeditions from the LSU Museum of Natural Science under the leadership of John O’Neill, occurred in the 1970s as a highway was built over the mountains around Abra Patricia. To this day, the area remains poorly known, as evidenced by the presence of species that still remain to be described and named. This lack of knowledge is particularly glaring given the high number of species and the complexity of bird distributions in the area. In eBird, for example, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/GuideMe?step=saveChoices&getLocations=ibas&parentState=PE-SAM&bMonth=01&bYear=1900&eMonth=12&eYear=2014&reportType=location&ibas=PE_24462&ibas=PE_14677&continue.x=55&continue.y=9&continue=Continue">735 bird species</a> are known from the two Important Bird Areas comprising Abra Patricia and the Mayo Valley. This is 100 more species than regularly occur in North America within the ABA area! A major goal of our big day effort was to help fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge of birds in the region, and to make that information publicly available. 

So we set out during scouting armed with cameras and recording units, and took careful notes bird bird species and numbers observed at each site. You can see a list of all of the scouting eBird checklists below, including embedded media. Our favorites include an <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20305822">hour spent with the spectacular hummingbirds</a> coming to the feeders at Waqanki Lodge, a hike up to <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20307854">the crest of a ridge</a> in a successful attempt to see Ash-throated Antwren, a quick visit to <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20308157">some new feeders</a> with Rufous-breasted Wood-Quail visiting, birding in <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20308584">some excellent roadside marshes</a>, productive <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20315248">night birding in fields</a> in the Mayo Valley, a <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20309865">check of the hummingbird feeders</a> at the owlet lodge at Abra Patricia, <a href="http://ebird.org/ebird/view/checklist?subID=S20309917">spending some time</a> with a bizarre little owl,
