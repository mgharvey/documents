Dissertation Outline
====================

**Dissertation goal:** Develop and evaluate new methods of obtaining phylogeographic datasets and apply them to comparative phylogeography of Amazonian birds.

Projects
---------------------

### Comparing sequence capture and RAD-Seq for phylogeography

We have been exploring the use of both sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and RAD-Seq in phylogeography. We, perhaps uniquely, have datasets from the same samples for both types of markers.

### *Xenops minutus* phylogeography using RAD-Seq

### Comparative phylogeography of varz√©a and terra firme birds in Amazonia

### Relationship between phylogeographic structure and higher-level speciation rate
